# condensate-quoeto
quoeto 4d language development by spacetimebird
This is the condensate trace for development process
  condensate= (reduction) ∩ (introductory content)
    trace= hook |given as experimental alignment of text render from https://thinkularity.com towards xd4
The external trace will link to the domain boot.science. it is not online yet.
The domain boot.science will be registered in the boot directory of the system as axiomatic (boot.directory) //and will evolve as a fundamental system whenever observed or computed\\
  The coexternal (co for cooperational i.e. human readable) variant could happen at http://weare.science
    The strategic background for coexternalization is gamification according to Ꝗ-G, a contained gamification theory
The condensate starts with a temp file that is highest order condensate of current workflow
# Natural language
//Quoeto is an artificial multi-domain language architecture. It consists of three language systems which are based on a specific type of logic. The logic is derived from a specific type of recursion which will be defined later. For now we reference the nature of this logic as 'irregular chiral hyperheuristics'. This is the bottom up construction of quoeto.
# Request and Pulls
This research is build on most recent findings in diverse fields of mathematics, physics, type theory, quantum field theory et cetera. I must rely on the experts in these domains to contribute to the project which is intended to produce a framework which has the properties of the computatery geometry I describe as quoeto. As it is based on multivalent logic which is painstaking to formalize in 2D language, I shortcut fields and explicit formulaeic renders.
