# quoeto
quoeto 4d language development
This is the condensate trace for development process
  condensate= (reduction) ∩ (introductory content)
    trace= hook |given as experimental alignment at https://thinkularity.com
The external trace will link to the domain http://boot.science but the domain is not online yet
The domain boot.science will be registered on the domain http://boot.directory as a fundamental system
  The coexternal (co for cooperational i.e. human readable) variant could happen at http://weare.science
    The strategic background for coexternalization is gamification according to Ꝗ-G, a contained gamification theory
The condensate starts with a temp file that is highest order condensate of current workflow

# Natural language
Quoeto is an artificial multi-domain language architecture. It consists of three language systems which are based on a specific type of logic. The logic is derived from a specific type of recursion which will be defined later. For now we reference the nature of this logic as 'irregular chiral hyperheuristics'. This is the bottom up construction of quoeto. inline comments start with // and end with \\ and the current state localization variable (center of self-referential attention) is denoted by aleph ℵ and is marked as ⟨ℵ⟩ whenever the staticity causes the system to stop evolution i.e. this is the position in the code at which the last time an computation was performed (i.e. the position in the text it was worked on most recent) and the progenitor context is marked by ⟨⟩ //i.e. its the last associative direction the authors focus underwent before placing a ⟨ℵ⟩ or executing the computation of the universe context (type-theory terminus)\\

# Request and Pulls
This research is build on most recent findings in diverse fields of mathematics, physics, type theory, quantum field theory et cetera. I must rely on the experts in these domains to contribute to the project which is intended to produce a framework which has the properties of the computatery geometry I describe as quoeto. As it is based on multivalent logic which is painstaking to formalize in 2D language, I shortcut fields and explicit formulaeic renders.

# Claim system
//To make understandable what I work on and to distribute (crowd write) the according scientific work, I will postulate a set of cheeky claims that challenge many established theories and assumptions. The function ϕ(xd4) is the reference function which is called for the densest packing of information in natural language (NL)

├ LMR can serve as foundation for a meta-category theory
    LMR advanced in a system language 'ini' can serve as foundation for any type of irregular recursive logic
        ini can be integrated into Q and Q can be integrated into ini //Q is any valid expression of theoretical physics\\
> The resulting dynamic grammar can be fixed in a state where parameters are set to:
  one down-spin iteration to align the indefinite integral of the architecture
  two up-spin iterations to reach conceptual cardinality (capability to transfer semantic content loss-free)
  one abstraction process which will produce trace condensates such as this code from line 23 to line 27

├ A sufficient (meta) theory of information generates internal entropy, i.e. if particles are described with sufficient detail they muste be / will be rendered into physical space
├ A coordinated synchronization of correct and complete theory systems around a singular subtheory (element/particle/content) generates a language not contained in classical chomsky hierarchy
├ A geometric computing IDE for polyparametric multiplex meta-networks := hypernetworks (meta-networks := are networks of hypergraphs with
  • complex dynamic systems as their nodes
  • domains of multilayer phase spaces as their hypercomplex edges
    //These phase spaces are essentially also quantifyable as meta-networks but possess discrete temporal characteristica {such as chimera synchronization, global mean increase, non-local interference, goal state harmonization, discretized momentum-correlahedron inertia induction, irregular inertia ⟨ℵ⟩ }\\.
    To reference this type of meta-network of (hyper)complex interconnections we refurbish the terminus of domain and use [domain] and specify an explicit contextual (formal) extension towards all previous concepts of the 'domain' terminus (math, internet, network science, cognition, etc.). 
  If a theory is developed from an inertial system that is within a [domain], its environment can either be referred to as the set of all other domains (types of complex interconnections as edges) from which some are unknown (the nodes of the hypergraph) or as a complex distribution of types of [domains] which produce groups which serve for empiric analysis are refered to as codomains [domain.co]

# Vocabulary
I introduce several new words and a system language architecture. Essentially this a work on the topics 'foundations of mathematics', 'foundations of theory of computation', 'foundations of multivalent multiplex network-systems' and 'complexity theory'. To ease the association between these terms, I introduce the term 'Anthropocomputation'.

# Current State
ϕ(xd4) is an information theory of information theories and hence a meta-information theory or a meta information-theory. 
  As the prefix 'meta' is not gauged and I do not want to impose too much systematization in the beginning, let the following be actual
# ϕ(xd4) ↔ Current Condensate[condensate]
compute{
λ(x), λ(xₒ), λ(λ(x) ∩ λ(xₒ))} as compute{x} := δ(xd)
⟨⟩
